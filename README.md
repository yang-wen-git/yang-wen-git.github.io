Sample code for students to use to create their portfolio site using github pages and codespaces

Create a repository called <your_username>.github.io
Copy these files into the folder
Add relevant images you want to display on the site to the static folder eg., your picture

Hyperlink it in your index.html, add styles based on your choice. 
Use codespaces or your own creativity to upload content on your resume to construct the rest of your portfolio site
